## BS 34-1A Emulator
This [emulator](testing/emulateSerPort.py) 
simulates the behavior of the BS 34-1A multichannel voltage source. 
It allows for testing with BLACS. When started, the emulator creates
a **virtual serial port** that behaves like a real BS 34-1A device. 
Programs can connect to this port and communicate with it as if 
it were the real device.

To launch the emulator:

```bash
python3 -m testing/BS_341A.emulateSerPort
```
You’ll see output like: For BS 34-1A use: /dev/pts/5

Use that port (e.g., /dev/pts/5) when connecting in `connection_table.py`. 


## ⚠️ Different Voltage Range on different channels (Hardware Defect)

The real BS 34-1A we own has **non-uniform voltage ranges**:

- **Channel 1** supports ±24 V
- **Channels 2–8** support ~ ±34.560 V

Labscript normalizes voltage values using a fixed `voltage_range`
parameter for the entire device. So, we add a _dirty_ workaround
in `voltage_source.set_voltage()` function. This workaround ensures 
all normalized values remain safe for the physical hardware.
